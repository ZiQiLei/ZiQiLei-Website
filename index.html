        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is ZiQi Lei. I am 21 year old. I am a current student at the University of California Riverside. Please allow me to introduce myself to you all. I am from ZhongShan, China, and I am majoring in studio art. I am going to complete my undergraduate studies at the University of California Riverside.  <br><br>

        In my view, I am an active, friendly and open minded person. In my spare time, I am fond of drawing. Drawing brings me fun and makes me love my life more. Sometimes, I would use my personal time to draw. I love to capture anything in my life, so I would use my pens or pencils to record them on my papers or computers. Four years of university education gives me a lot of things  to learn, a lot of things to try, and a lot of practices to improve myself. With time going, the more I learned , the clearer I realized that I am obsessed with the knowledge in the field of Graphic Design. But it is not enough, I am eager to learn more about it. Compared with undergraduates, postgraduates tend to have a wide scope of knowledge, be more professional and have broader horizons. Postgraduate studies will give me more power and a realistic approach. And I love being in my college, because it is full of passion and youthful spirit. As a student in my university, I would like to socialize with others, because I always like to communicate with other people. During the school years, I learned a lot from different people by talking with them. It was fun for me to communicate with strangers, or other people have the same hobbies as me.<br><br>

        Also, When I was in high school, I used to play basketball because I was in a basketball club, I usually practiced basketball with my teammates after school. I gained a lot of useful basketball skills and a lot of meaningful experiences. Sometimes, I volunteered in a non-profit organization called ‚Äú APEN‚Äù. It was an organization that helped older people to solve problems. When they were having meetings, we would be there to help them setting the tables and chairs. When they were getting food, we would be there to serve food. It was great for me to have such a great opportunity to be part of this group, because I would like to help older people, especially immigrants, to be part of this society. As an immigrant myself, I used to get a lot of help from others, so I would be happy to help those who need help. As a high school student, I used to work in a store as a seller to make money for myself. I loved my job position, because I had to deal with different people everyday to make them satisfied. I had to remember one thing was customers were always right, because solving their problems and helping them were what I must do on my job.
